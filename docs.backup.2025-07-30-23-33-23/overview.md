# Project Overview: ai-documentor

## What This Application Does

The ai-documentor is a handy tool designed to simplify the life of developers and coders. It helps in creating detailed documentation for software projects, a task that can often be time-consuming and complex. This application is particularly useful for developers who need to share their work with others, whether it's for collaboration, code review, or simply to make their codebase more understandable. What sets ai-documentor apart is its ability to automatically generate documentation from code, saving developers a significant amount of time and effort.

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

When a user runs the ai-documentor on their codebase, the application scans through all the files and generates a comprehensive documentation. This includes information about the functions, components, dependencies, and more. The user experience is smooth and intuitive, with the application doing most of the heavy lifting. The result is a well-structured, easy-to-understand documentation that provides a clear overview of the codebase.

## Technology Overview (Friendly)

The ai-documentor is built on a robust technology stack that includes Express and React. These technologies were chosen for their flexibility, scalability, and wide community support. Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, and it's used to handle the backend operations of the application. On the other hand, React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it's used to create the frontend of the application. Together, these technologies allow ai-documentor to deliver a smooth and efficient user experience.
