# Frontend Features & Functionality Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the frontend features and functionalities of our application. It covers the core features, user interface components, user workflows and interactions, data and information display, and navigation and user experience.

## 1. Core Features Overview

The application is designed to provide users with a seamless experience in managing their tasks. The core features include:

- **Task Management**: Users can create, update, and delete tasks.
- **Task Prioritization**: Users can prioritize their tasks based on their importance and urgency.
- **Task Scheduling**: Users can schedule their tasks for specific dates and times.
- **Task Notifications**: Users receive notifications for upcoming and overdue tasks.

## 2. User Interface Components

The application consists of various user interface components that facilitate user interaction:

- **Task Input Form**: This form allows users to input their tasks, set their priority, and schedule them.
- **Task List**: This component displays the list of tasks. Each task item shows the task name, priority, and schedule.
- **Task Edit Button**: This button allows users to edit a task.
- **Task Delete Button**: This button allows users to delete a task.
- **Notification Icon**: This icon displays the number of upcoming and overdue tasks.

## 3. User Workflows & Interactions

The typical user journey involves the following steps:

1. Users input their tasks using the task input form.
2. The tasks are displayed in the task list.
3. Users can edit or delete tasks using the task edit and delete buttons.
4. Users receive notifications for upcoming and overdue tasks through the notification icon.

## 4. Data & Information Display

The application displays the following information to users:

- **Task List**: The task list displays the task name, priority, and schedule for each task.
- **Notifications**: The notification icon displays the number of upcoming and overdue tasks.

Users can interact with the displayed information by editing or deleting tasks from the task list and checking notifications for upcoming and overdue tasks.

## 5. Navigation & User Experience

The application uses a single-page layout, allowing users to manage their tasks without having to navigate between different pages. The task input form, task list, and notification icon are all located on the same page, providing a streamlined user experience.

The application also uses responsive design to optimize the user experience on different devices. The layout and components automatically adjust to fit the screen size of the device, ensuring that users can easily interact with the application on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Technical Architecture

# Frontend Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend architecture of our application. The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. The styling is done using CSS and SCSS, a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted into CSS.

## 1. Architecture Philosophy and Patterns Used

The architecture of our frontend follows the component-based architecture pattern. This pattern promotes reusability of components and a clear separation of concerns. Each component has its own logic and controls its own rendering, and can be thought of as a self-contained entity.

We also adhere to the principle of 'unidirectional data flow'. This means that the state is passed down from parent components to child components through props, and changes to the state are communicated up to the parent components through callbacks.

## 2. Component Hierarchy and Organization

Our component hierarchy is organized based on the 'container-component' pattern. Container components are concerned with how things work, and they provide the data and behavior to presentational or child components. 

The components are organized in a hierarchical structure, with each component residing in its own directory. The directory name matches the name of the component for easy identification. Each directory contains the component's JavaScript and CSS files, along with any assets that the component might need.

## 3. State Management Approach

For state management, we use React's built-in state management capabilities, supplemented by the Context API for passing data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

We have chosen this approach because it is lightweight and fully integrated with React, and it provides all the functionality we need for state management without the added complexity of external libraries.

## 4. Styling Methodology

Our styling methodology is based on CSS and SCSS. We use CSS for basic styling and layout, and SCSS for more complex styles and to take advantage of features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which make our stylesheets more readable and maintainable.

Each component has its own SCSS file, which is imported into the component's JavaScript file. This ensures that the styles are scoped to the component, and do not leak into other parts of the application.

## 5. Key UI Patterns and Conventions

We follow a number of UI patterns and conventions to ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience. These include:

- **Consistent Navigation**: Navigation elements are consistently placed and styled across the application.
- **Feedback**: We provide immediate feedback to user actions to make the application feel responsive.
- **Form Validation**: We provide real-time validation feedback as users fill out forms.
- **Error Handling**: We handle errors gracefully and provide helpful error messages to the user.

In conclusion, our frontend architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, and maintainable, with a focus on delivering a high-quality user experience.
