# Project Deployment Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions for deploying the Node.js project. It covers prerequisites, environment setup, build process, deployment steps, post-deployment, and troubleshooting.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start the deployment process, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).
- NPM (Node Package Manager), which comes with Node.js.
- A code editor such as Visual Studio Code.
- An account on a deployment platform, such as Heroku or AWS.

## 2. Environment Setup

To set up your environment:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project-directory>
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the following dependencies: @babel/parser, @babel/preset-env, @babel/traverse, @babel/types, chalk, chokidar, commander, dotenv, ejs, express.

## 3. Build Process

To build the application:

1. Run the build script:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript files and copies the `src/templates` directory to the `dist/` directory.

## 4. Deployment Steps

Deployment steps may vary depending on the platform. Here is a general guide:

1. Push the project to your deployment platform.
2. Set the start command to `node dist/cli.js`.
3. Set the environment variables as required by your application.

## 5. Post-Deployment

After deployment, verify that the application is running correctly:

1. Visit the application URL provided by your deployment platform.
2. Monitor the application logs for any errors.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment:

- Check the application logs for any error messages.
- Ensure all environment variables are set correctly.
- Make sure you have installed all the required dependencies.

For specific issues related to the deployment platform, refer to the platform's official documentation or support channels.

## Conclusion

This guide should help you deploy the Node.js project. If you encounter any issues not covered in this guide, please refer to the official Node.js, NPM, and your deployment platform's documentation.
