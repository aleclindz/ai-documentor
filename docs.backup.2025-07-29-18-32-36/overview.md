# ai-documentor Project Overview

## 1. Project Purpose
The ai-documentor is a software project designed to automate the process of generating documentation for codebases. It is intended for developers and teams who want to streamline their documentation process and ensure consistency and accuracy in their project documentation.

## 2. Technology Stack
The ai-documentor project utilizes a variety of frameworks, libraries, and tools:

- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side of the application.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, although no files in the current codebase utilize it.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used for converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript.
- **Chalk**: A library for styling terminal string outputs.
- **Chokidar**: A library providing an efficient and powerful API for file watching.
- **Commander**: A complete solution for node.js command-line interfaces.
- **Dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **EJS**: A simple templating language for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **Glob**: A library for matching files using the patterns the shell uses.
- **Inquirer**: A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.
- **Marked**: A markdown parser and compiler built for speed.
- **Mermaid**: A simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via JavaScript.
- **OpenAI**: An API for accessing OpenAI services.
- **Ora**: A library for creating elegant terminal spinners.
- **ts-morph**: A library for navigating and transforming TypeScript and JavaScript code.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **ws**: A simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and server for Node.js.

## 3. Architecture Overview
The application follows a simple architecture with the majority of the codebase focused on the backend. The backend is built with Express and is responsible for generating the documentation. The application does not currently have a frontend.

## 4. Key Features
The main functionality of the ai-documentor is to generate documentation for a given codebase. It does this by parsing the codebase, extracting relevant information, and then generating documentation based on that information.

## 5. Project Structure
The project is structured into a few key files and directories:

- `src/`: Contains the main application code.
- `src/cli.ts`: The entry point for the command-line interface.
- `src/server/`: Contains the server-side code for the application.
- `src/generators/`: Contains the code for generating documentation.
- `tests/`: Contains test setup and configuration files.
- `jest.config.js`: Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework used.
- `tsconfig.json`: Configuration file for TypeScript.
- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.
- `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.
- `README.md`: The introductory documentation for the project.

## 6. Getting Started
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`. You can then run the project using `npm start`. To generate documentation for a codebase, use the command-line interface provided by the application.
