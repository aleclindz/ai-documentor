## Service Functions

The service functions are responsible for the business logic and data processing. They interact with the database to retrieve, create, update, and delete data. They also handle any necessary data transformations.

## Middleware

The middleware provides additional functionality to the application, such as authentication, validation, and logging. The `authenticateToken` middleware is used to ensure that the user is authenticated before accessing certain endpoints.

## Error Handling

Errors are handled by catching any exceptions that are thrown during the execution of the application. The error message is then returned in the response to the client.

## Database Integration

The application interacts with the database through the `userService` module. This module provides functions for retrieving, creating, updating, and deleting users in the database.
