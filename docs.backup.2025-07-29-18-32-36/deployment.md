# Deployment Guide

This guide provides detailed instructions on how to deploy the Node.js application. It covers prerequisites, environment setup, build process, deployment steps, post-deployment verification, and troubleshooting.

## 1. Prerequisites

Before you start the deployment process, ensure you have the following tools and accounts:

- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)
- npm (version 6.0.0 or later)
- Git

To check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

## 2. Environment Setup

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository_url>
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd <project_directory>
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. 

## 3. Build Process

To build the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript files and copies the `src/templates` directory to the `dist/` directory.

## 4. Deployment Steps

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

## 5. Post-Deployment

After deployment, verify that the application is running correctly by navigating to the application URL in your web browser. 

To monitor the application, consider using a tool like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to keep the application running continuously.

## 6. Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the deployment process, consider the following troubleshooting steps:

- Check the Node.js and npm versions. This application requires Node.js version 14.0.0 or later and npm version 6.0.0 or later.
- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.
- If the application fails to start, check the console for any error messages. These messages can provide clues about what went wrong.
- If the application starts but doesn't work as expected, check the application logs for any error messages.
