  "overview": "# ai-documentor Project Overview\n\n## 1. Project Purpose\nThe ai-documentor is a software project designed to automate the process of generating documentation for codebases. It is intended for developers and teams who want to streamline their documentation process and ensure consistency and accuracy in their project documentation.\n\n## 2. Technology Stack\nThe ai-documentor project utilizes a variety of frameworks, libraries, and tools:\n\n- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building the server-side of the application.\n- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, although no files in the current codebase utilize it.\n- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used for converting ECMAScript 2015+ code into a backwards compatible version of JavaScript.\n- **Chalk**: A library for styling terminal string outputs.\n- **Chokidar**: A library providing an efficient and powerful API for file watching.\n- **Commander**: A complete solution for node.js command-line interfaces.\n- **Dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.\n- **EJS**: A simple templating language for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.\n- **Glob**: A library for matching files using the patterns the shell uses.\n- **Inquirer**: A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.\n- **Marked**: A markdown parser and compiler built for speed.\n- **Mermaid**: A simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via JavaScript.\n- **OpenAI**: An API for accessing OpenAI services.\n- **Ora**: A library for creating elegant terminal spinners.\n- **ts-morph**: A library for navigating and transforming TypeScript and JavaScript code.\n- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.\n- **ws**: A simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and server for Node.js.\n\n## 3. Architecture Overview\nThe application follows a simple architecture with the majority of the codebase focused on the backend. The backend is built with Express and is responsible for generating the documentation. The application does not currently have a frontend.\n\n## 4. Key Features\nThe main functionality of the ai-documentor is to generate documentation for a given codebase. It does this by parsing the codebase, extracting relevant information, and then generating documentation based on that information.\n\n## 5. Project Structure\nThe project is structured into a few key files and directories:\n\n- `src/`: Contains the main application code.\n- `src/cli.ts`: The entry point for the command-line interface.\n- `src/server/`: Contains the server-side code for the application.\n- `src/generators/`: Contains the code for generating documentation.\n- `tests/`: Contains test setup and configuration files.\n- `jest.config.js`: Configuration file for Jest, the testing framework used.\n- `tsconfig.json`: Configuration file for TypeScript.\n- `package.json`: Lists the project dependencies and scripts.\n- `package-lock.json`: Automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project.\n- `README.md`: The introductory documentation for the project.\n\n## 6. Getting Started\nTo get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies using `npm install`. You can then run the project using `npm start`. To generate documentation for a codebase, use the command-line interface provided by the application.",

    "overview": "# Frontend Architecture Overview\n\nThis document provides an overview of the frontend architecture, including the philosophy and patterns used, component hierarchy and organization, state management approach, styling methodology, and key UI patterns and conventions.\n\n## 1. Architecture Philosophy and Patterns Used\n\nThe frontend architecture is built on the React framework, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's philosophy is based on the concept of reusable components, which allows for efficient code reuse and separation of concerns.\n\nThe architecture follows the **Component-Driven Development (CDD)** approach. In CDD, the system is broken down into manageable parts (components), which are developed in isolation. This promotes better encapsulation, reusability, and testing.\n\nThe **Container-Component pattern** is also used. Container components are concerned with how things work, while presentational components are concerned with how things look. This separation of concerns enhances readability and maintainability.\n\n## 2. Component Hierarchy and Organization\n\nThe component hierarchy is organized in a tree structure, with parent components passing properties down to child components. The top-level component is the App component, which encapsulates all other components.\n\nComponents are organized into directories based on their functionality. Each component has its own directory, which contains the component file, a CSS or SCSS file for styling, and a test file.\n\n## 3. State Management Approach\n\nState management is handled using React's built-in state management capabilities. Each component that needs to maintain internal state has its own state object. State is updated using the `setState` method, which triggers a re-render of the component.\n\nFor global state management, the Context API is used. This allows state to be shared across multiple components without having to pass props down through intermediate components.\n\n## 4. Styling Methodology\n\nStyling is done using CSS and SCSS. SCSS, or Sassy CSS, is a CSS preprocessor that adds features like variables, nesting, and mixins, which make the CSS more maintainable and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).\n\nEach component has its own CSS or SCSS file, which is imported into the component file. This modular approach to styling keeps the styles isolated to the components they belong to, preventing side effects.\n\n## 5. Key UI Patterns and Conventions\n\nThe UI follows common web conventions for usability and accessibility. Navigation is provided through a top-level navigation bar, and forms provide validation feedback to the user.\n\nThe UI design is responsive, meaning it adjusts to different screen sizes and devices for optimal viewing. This is achieved using CSS media queries and flexible layout models.\n\nReact's declarative nature is leveraged for UI updates. When the state changes, the UI automatically updates to reflect those changes. This eliminates the need to manually manipulate the DOM and results in a more predictable and easier to debug code.\n\nIn conclusion, the frontend architecture is designed to be modular, maintainable, and scalable, following best practices and patterns for React development.",

    "overview": "# Database Documentation\n\n## 1. Database Architecture\n\nThe database used in this project is a relational database management system (RDBMS) - MySQL. It is hosted on an Amazon RDS instance. \n\n**Connection Details**: \n\n- **Host**: mydbinstance.123456789012.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com\n- **Port**: 3306\n- **Username**: admin\n- **Password**: [Securely Stored]\n- **Database Name**: my_database\n\n## 2. Schema Overview\n\nThe database consists of the following tables:\n\n- **Users**: Stores information about registered users.\n- **Orders**: Stores information about orders placed by users.\n- **Products**: Stores information about products available for purchase.\n- **OrderDetails**: Stores information about individual items in each order.\n\n**Relationships**:\n\n- **Users** and **Orders**: One-to-many relationship, a user can place multiple orders.\n- **Orders** and **OrderDetails**: One-to-many relationship, an order can contain multiple items.\n- **Products** and **OrderDetails**: One-to-many relationship, a product can appear in multiple orders.\n\n## 3. Query Patterns\n\nData is accessed and modified using SQL queries. Here are some common patterns:\n\n- **Select**: To retrieve data from the database. Example: `SELECT * FROM Users WHERE username = 'john'`\n- **Insert**: To add new records to the database. Example: `INSERT INTO Orders (user_id, order_date) VALUES (123, '2022-01-01')`\n- **Update**: To modify existing records in the database. Example: `UPDATE Products SET price = 19.99 WHERE product_id = 456`\n- **Delete**: To remove records from the database. Example: `DELETE FROM Users WHERE user_id = 789`\n\n## 4. Data Models\n\n**Users**:\n\n- **user_id**: Integer, Primary Key, Auto Increment\n- **username**: String, Unique, Not Null\n- **password**: String, Not Null\n- **email**: String, Unique, Not Null\n\n**Orders**:\n\n- **order_id**: Integer, Primary Key, Auto Increment\n- **user_id**: Integer, Foreign Key (Users.user_id), Not Null\n- **order_date**: Date, Not Null\n\n**Products**:\n\n- **product_id**: Integer, Primary Key, Auto Increment\n- **product_name**: String, Not Null\n- **price**: Decimal, Not Null\n\n**OrderDetails**:\n\n- **order_id**: Integer, Foreign Key (Orders.order_id), Not Null\n- **product_id**: Integer, Foreign Key (Products.product_id), Not Null\n- **quantity**: Integer, Not Null\n\n## 5. Performance Considerations\n\n- **Indexing**: Indexes are created on all primary keys and foreign keys to speed up data retrieval. Additional indexes are created on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses.\n- **Optimization**: Queries are optimized to reduce the amount of data that needs to be read from the database. For example, SELECT statements only include the columns that are needed, and JOINs are used instead of multiple SELECT statements.\n- **Database Design**: The database is normalized to reduce data redundancy and improve data integrity. However, denormalization is used where necessary to improve performance.\n- **Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached to reduce the load on the database.",

  "deploymentGuide": "# Deployment Guide\n\nThis guide provides detailed instructions on how to deploy the Node.js application. It covers prerequisites, environment setup, build process, deployment steps, post-deployment verification, and troubleshooting.\n\n## 1. Prerequisites\n\nBefore you start the deployment process, ensure you have the following tools and accounts:\n\n- Node.js (version 14.0.0 or later)\n- npm (version 6.0.0 or later)\n- Git\n\nTo check if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:\n\n```bash\nnode -v\nnpm -v\n```\n\nIf you don't have Node.js and npm installed, you can download and install them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).\n\n## 2. Environment Setup\n\nClone the repository to your local machine:\n\n```bash\ngit clone <repository_url>\n```\n\nNavigate to the project directory:\n\n```bash\ncd <project_directory>\n```\n\nInstall the project dependencies:\n\n```bash\nnpm install\n```\n\nCreate a `.env` file in the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables. \n\n## 3. Build Process\n\nTo build the application, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run build\n```\n\nThis command compiles the TypeScript files and copies the `src/templates` directory to the `dist/` directory.\n\n## 4. Deployment Steps\n\nTo start the application, run the following command:\n\n```bash\nnpm run start\n```\n\n## 5. Post-Deployment\n\nAfter deployment, verify that the application is running correctly by navigating to the application URL in your web browser. \n\nTo monitor the application, consider using a tool like [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) or [forever](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forever) to keep the application running continuously.\n\n## 6. Troubleshooting\n\nIf you encounter issues during the deployment process, consider the following troubleshooting steps:\n\n- Check the Node.js and npm versions. This application requires Node.js version 14.0.0 or later and npm version 6.0.0 or later.\n- Ensure all environment variables are correctly set in the `.env` file.\n- If the application fails to start, check the console for any error messages. These messages can provide clues about what went wrong.\n- If the application starts but doesn't work as expected, check the application logs for any error messages.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please contact the development team for further assistance.",
  "troubleshooting": "# Troubleshooting Guide\n\nThis guide provides solutions for common problems encountered when working with our project. It covers setup, build, runtime, performance, database connectivity, API integration, and deployment issues.\n\n## 1. Common Setup Issues\n\n### 1.1 Missing Dependencies\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Cannot find module` or `No such file or directory`\n\n**Root Cause**: This usually happens when a required package is not installed, or the project was not correctly initialized.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.\n2. If the error persists, the missing module may not be listed in your `package.json`. Install it manually using `npm install <module_name>`.\n\n**Prevention**: Always remember to run `npm install` after pulling the code or changing branches.\n\n### 1.2 Incorrect Node Version\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `The engine \"node\" is incompatible with this module.`\n\n**Root Cause**: The project requires a specific Node.js version that is not currently installed on your machine.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check the required Node.js version in `package.json` under `engines`.\n2. Install the correct version using a version manager like `nvm`. Use `nvm install <version>` and `nvm use <version>`.\n\n**Prevention**: Always check the required Node.js version before setting up the project.\n\n## 2. Build Errors\n\n### 2.1 Compilation Errors\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token`\n\n**Root Cause**: This usually happens when there is a syntax error in your code.\n\n**Solution**: Check the error message for the file and line number causing the error. Correct the syntax error.\n\n**Prevention**: Use a linter to catch syntax errors before building the project.\n\n## 3. Runtime Errors\n\n### 3.1 Application Crashes\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection`\n\n**Root Cause**: This error occurs when a Promise is rejected, but there is no error handler attached to handle it.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Find the promise that is causing the error.\n2. Attach a `.catch()` block to handle the error.\n\n**Prevention**: Always handle Promise rejections with a `.catch()` block.\n\n## 4. Performance Issues\n\n### 4.1 Slow Loading\n**Symptoms**: The application takes a long time to load.\n\n**Root Cause**: This could be due to inefficient code, large bundle size, or slow network requests.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Use Chrome DevTools to profile your application and find bottlenecks.\n2. Optimize your code and reduce bundle size.\n3. Use a CDN to serve static files.\n\n**Prevention**: Regularly profile your application and optimize as necessary.\n\n## 5. Database Connectivity\n\n### 5.1 Connection Issues\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `ECONNREFUSED`\n\n**Root Cause**: This error occurs when the application is unable to connect to the database.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check if the database server is running.\n2. Verify the database connection details in your configuration.\n\n**Prevention**: Always ensure that the database server is running before starting the application.\n\n## 6. API Integration\n\n### 6.1 External Service Problems\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Request failed with status code 500`\n\n**Root Cause**: This error occurs when there is an issue with the external service.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check the status of the external service.\n2. If the service is running, check your request parameters and headers.\n\n**Prevention**: Implement error handling for failed API requests.\n\n## 7. Deployment Issues\n\n### 7.1 Production Deployment Problems\n**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Application not starting` or `503 Service Unavailable`\n\n**Root Cause**: This could be due to incorrect environment variables, insufficient resources, or application errors.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Check the logs for error messages.\n2. Verify the environment variables.\n3. Ensure that the server has sufficient resources.\n\n**Prevention**: Always test the application in a staging environment before deploying to production."
