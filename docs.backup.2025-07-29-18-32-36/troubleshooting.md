# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide provides solutions for common problems encountered when working with our project. It covers setup, build, runtime, performance, database connectivity, API integration, and deployment issues.

## 1. Common Setup Issues

### 1.1 Missing Dependencies
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Cannot find module` or `No such file or directory`

**Root Cause**: This usually happens when a required package is not installed, or the project was not correctly initialized.

**Solution**:
1. Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies listed in `package.json`.
2. If the error persists, the missing module may not be listed in your `package.json`. Install it manually using `npm install <module_name>`.

**Prevention**: Always remember to run `npm install` after pulling the code or changing branches.

### 1.2 Incorrect Node Version
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `The engine "node" is incompatible with this module.`

**Root Cause**: The project requires a specific Node.js version that is not currently installed on your machine.

**Solution**:
1. Check the required Node.js version in `package.json` under `engines`.
2. Install the correct version using a version manager like `nvm`. Use `nvm install <version>` and `nvm use <version>`.

**Prevention**: Always check the required Node.js version before setting up the project.

## 2. Build Errors

### 2.1 Compilation Errors
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `SyntaxError: Unexpected token`

**Root Cause**: This usually happens when there is a syntax error in your code.

**Solution**: Check the error message for the file and line number causing the error. Correct the syntax error.

**Prevention**: Use a linter to catch syntax errors before building the project.

## 3. Runtime Errors

### 3.1 Application Crashes
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection`

**Root Cause**: This error occurs when a Promise is rejected, but there is no error handler attached to handle it.

**Solution**:
1. Find the promise that is causing the error.
2. Attach a `.catch()` block to handle the error.

**Prevention**: Always handle Promise rejections with a `.catch()` block.

## 4. Performance Issues

### 4.1 Slow Loading
**Symptoms**: The application takes a long time to load.

**Root Cause**: This could be due to inefficient code, large bundle size, or slow network requests.

**Solution**:
1. Use Chrome DevTools to profile your application and find bottlenecks.
2. Optimize your code and reduce bundle size.
3. Use a CDN to serve static files.

**Prevention**: Regularly profile your application and optimize as necessary.

## 5. Database Connectivity

### 5.1 Connection Issues
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `ECONNREFUSED`

**Root Cause**: This error occurs when the application is unable to connect to the database.

**Solution**:
1. Check if the database server is running.
2. Verify the database connection details in your configuration.

**Prevention**: Always ensure that the database server is running before starting the application.

## 6. API Integration

### 6.1 External Service Problems
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Request failed with status code 500`

**Root Cause**: This error occurs when there is an issue with the external service.

**Solution**:
1. Check the status of the external service.
2. If the service is running, check your request parameters and headers.

**Prevention**: Implement error handling for failed API requests.

## 7. Deployment Issues

### 7.1 Production Deployment Problems
**Symptoms and Error Messages**: `Application not starting` or `503 Service Unavailable`

**Root Cause**: This could be due to incorrect environment variables, insufficient resources, or application errors.

**Solution**:
1. Check the logs for error messages.
2. Verify the environment variables.
3. Ensure that the server has sufficient resources.

**Prevention**: Always test the application in a staging environment before deploying to production.
