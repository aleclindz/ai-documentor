# Frontend Features & Functionality Documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the frontend features and functionality of our application. It is designed to help developers understand the user interface, workflows, data display, and navigation patterns.

## 1. Core Features Overview

Our application is designed to provide users with an intuitive and efficient way to manage their tasks. The main features include:

- Task creation: Users can create new tasks with a title, description, and priority level.
- Task management: Users can edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- Task filtering: Users can filter tasks based on their status (completed or not) and priority level.
- User account management: Users can create an account, log in, and manage their profile.

## 2. User Interface Components

The user interface consists of various components that facilitate user interaction:

- **Task form**: This form is used to create new tasks. It includes fields for the task title, description, and priority level.
- **Task list**: This component displays all the tasks created by the user. Each task item includes a checkbox to mark the task as completed, an edit button, and a delete button.
- **Filter form**: This form allows users to filter tasks based on their status and priority level.
- **User account form**: This form is used for account creation and login. It includes fields for the username and password.

## 3. User Workflows & Interactions

The typical user journey through the application involves the following steps:

1. **Account creation/login**: Users start by creating an account or logging into their existing account.
2. **Task creation**: Users can create new tasks using the task form.
3. **Task management**: Users can manage their tasks using the task list. They can mark tasks as completed, edit task details, or delete tasks.
4. **Task filtering**: Users can filter their tasks using the filter form.

## 4. Data & Information Display

The application displays data in the following ways:

- **Task list**: The task list displays all the tasks created by the user. Each task item includes the task title, description, priority level, and status.
- **User profile**: The user profile displays the username and the number of tasks created by the user.

## 5. Navigation & User Experience

The application uses a simple and intuitive navigation pattern:

- **Top navigation bar**: The top navigation bar includes links to the task list, task creation form, filter form, and user profile.
- **Task list**: The task list includes links to the task edit form for each task.

The user experience is optimized through the use of clear labels, intuitive form design, and responsive layout. The application also provides feedback to the user through success and error messages.

## Technical Architecture

# Frontend Architecture Documentation

## 1. Architecture Philosophy and Patterns Used

The frontend architecture is built on the principles of modularity, reusability, and maintainability. It is designed using the React framework, which follows the component-based architecture. This architecture allows us to break down the application into smaller, reusable pieces that can be managed independently. 

### 1.1. Component-Based Architecture

In the component-based architecture, the UI is broken down into individual components. Each component has its own logic and controls its own rendering. They can be reused across different parts of the application, which promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

### 1.2. Single Page Application (SPA)

The frontend is designed as a Single Page Application (SPA). This means that most resources (HTML/CSS/Scripts) are only loaded once throughout the lifespan of the application. Only data is transmitted back and forth. This results in a more fluid user experience.

## 2. Component Hierarchy and Organization

The component hierarchy is organized based on the feature and functionality they provide. The root component is the `App` component, which acts as the container for all other components.

### 2.1. Directory Structure

The components are organized in directories based on their role in the application. For example, all components related to user authentication are stored in the `auth` directory, components for the dashboard are in the `dashboard` directory, and so on.

## 3. State Management Approach

The state management in the application is handled using React's built-in state management capabilities. 

### 3.1. Local State

Each component maintains its own local state. This state is private to the component and can be changed by the component itself.

### 3.2. Global State

For state that needs to be shared across multiple components, we use React's Context API. This allows us to share state without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree.

## 4. Styling Methodology

The styling of the application is done using CSS and SCSS. 

### 4.1. CSS

CSS is used for basic styling of the components. Each component has its own CSS file, which is imported into the component file.

### 4.2. SCSS

SCSS is used for more complex styling needs. It allows us to use features like variables, nested rules, and mixins, which make the styles more maintainable and easier to manage.

## 5. Key UI Patterns and Conventions

The UI follows a consistent pattern and convention across the application. 

### 5.1. Responsive Design

The application is designed to be responsive. It adjusts its layout based on the screen size of the device it's being viewed on.

### 5.2. Accessibility

The application follows best practices for accessibility. All interactive elements are keyboard accessible, and appropriate ARIA roles and attributes are used to ensure the application is accessible to users with assistive technologies.

### 5.3. User Feedback

The application provides clear user feedback. For example, form validation messages are displayed to provide feedback to the user about the data they have entered.
