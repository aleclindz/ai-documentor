# Troubleshooting Guide

This document provides a comprehensive troubleshooting guide for common issues encountered when working with the Express and React project. It covers setup issues, build errors, runtime errors, performance issues, database connectivity, API integration, and deployment issues.

## 1. Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `Cannot find module` error
- `npm ERR! code E404` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors are typically due to missing or incorrectly installed dependencies.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. If the error persists, delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure to run `npm install` after pulling new code, as the dependencies may have changed.

## 2. Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `Module not found: Can't resolve '...' in '...'` error
- `Failed to compile` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors usually occur when there are missing files or incorrect import paths in the code.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Check the import paths in your code to ensure they are correct.
2. If the error persists, run `npm run build` to see if the error message provides more details about the issue.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure to check your import paths and file locations before running the build command.

## 3. Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `TypeError: Cannot read property '...' of undefined` error
- `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Unhandled promise rejection` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors usually occur when the code tries to access a property of an undefined variable or fails to handle a rejected promise.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Check your code for any variables that may not have been defined before they are used.
2. Ensure all promises have a `.catch()` block to handle any errors.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure to initialize your variables before using them and handle promise rejections.

## 4. Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- Slow loading times
- High memory usage

### Root Cause Analysis

These issues can be caused by inefficient code, memory leaks, or large data sets.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Use performance profiling tools like Chrome DevTools to identify bottlenecks in your code.
2. Check your code for any potential memory leaks, such as variables that are not being de-referenced.

### Prevention Strategies

Regularly profile your application and optimize your code to ensure it runs efficiently.

## 5. Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `ECONNREFUSED` error
- `ER_BAD_DB_ERROR` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors usually occur when the application is unable to connect to the database or the database name is incorrect.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Check your database connection details (host, port, username, password, database name) to ensure they are correct.
2. If the error persists, ensure that the database server is running and accessible from your application.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure your database connection details are correct and the database server is running.

## 6. API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `Request failed with status code 404` error
- `Request failed with status code 500` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors usually occur when the API endpoint is incorrect or the API server encounters an error.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Check your API endpoints to ensure they are correct.
2. If the error persists, check the API server for any potential issues.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure your API endpoints are correct and the API server is running smoothly.

## 7. Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages

- `Application not starting` error
- `Application crashing` error

### Root Cause Analysis

These errors usually occur when there are issues with the deployment configuration or the server environment.

### Step-by-step Solutions

1. Check your deployment configuration to ensure it is correct.
2. If the error persists, check the server logs for any potential issues.

### Prevention Strategies

Always ensure your deployment configuration is correct and the server environment is properly set up.
