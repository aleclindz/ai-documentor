## Database Architecture

The project uses a PostgreSQL database hosted on AWS RDS. The database is connected to the application using the psycopg2 Python library. The connection details are as follows:

- Host: `database-1.cqo3v3i3r0dd.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `mydatabase`
- User: `mydatabaseuser`
- Password: `mypassword`

Please note that the above details are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual connection details.

## Schema Overview

The database consists of the following tables:

1. `users`: Stores user information.
2. `products`: Stores product details.
3. `orders`: Stores order details.
4. `order_items`: Stores the items in each order.

The relationships between the tables are as follows:

- `users` to `orders`: One-to-many relationship. Each user can have multiple orders.
- `orders` to `order_items`: One-to-many relationship. Each order can have multiple items.
- `products` to `order_items`: One-to-many relationship. Each product can be in multiple order items.

## Query Patterns

Data is accessed and modified in the application through SQL queries. Here are some common patterns:

- Selecting all rows from a table: `SELECT * FROM table_name`
- Selecting specific columns: `SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name`
- Filtering rows: `SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition`
- Inserting a new row: `INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES (value1, value2)`
- Updating a row: `UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1 WHERE condition`
- Deleting a row: `DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition`

## Data Models

Here are the structures and validation rules for the tables:

- `users`: 
  - `id`: Integer, primary key, auto-increment
  - `username`: String, unique, not null
  - `password`: String, not null
  - `email`: String, unique, not null

- `products`: 
  - `id`: Integer, primary key, auto-increment
  - `name`: String, not null
  - `price`: Decimal, not null

- `orders`: 
  - `id`: Integer, primary key, auto-increment
  - `user_id`: Integer, foreign key (`users.id`), not null
  - `date`: Date, not null

- `order_items`: 
  - `id`: Integer, primary key, auto-increment
  - `order_id`: Integer, foreign key (`orders.id`), not null
  - `product_id`: Integer, foreign key (`products.id`), not null
  - `quantity`: Integer, not null

## Performance Considerations

The database uses indexing to improve query performance. Each table has an index on its primary key.

To further optimize performance, consider adding indexes on columns that are frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions. For example, an index on `orders.user_id` could speed up queries that join the `users` and `orders` tables.

Also, consider using EXPLAIN ANALYZE to understand the performance of your queries and identify potential bottlenecks.
