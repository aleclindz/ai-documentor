# Deployment Guide

This guide provides a comprehensive step-by-step process to deploy the Node.js application.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- TypeScript (v4.0.0 or later)
- Jest (v26.0.0 or later)

You will also need accounts for the following services:

- GitHub (for source code management)
- Heroku (for deployment)

## Environment Setup

This application uses environment variables for configuration. These are stored in a `.env` file at the root of the project. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=3000
```

Install the project dependencies with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Build Process

The application uses TypeScript, which needs to be compiled to JavaScript before it can be run. Use the following command to build the application:

```bash
npm run build
```

This command compiles the TypeScript code to JavaScript, outputting it to the `dist` directory.

## Deployment Steps

This guide uses Heroku for deployment. If you don't have the Heroku CLI installed, you can download it [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli).

1. Log in to Heroku:

    ```bash
    heroku login
    ```

2. Create a new Heroku app:

    ```bash
    heroku create your-app-name
    ```

3. Push your code to the Heroku repository:

    ```bash
    git push heroku master
    ```

4. Start your application:

    ```bash
    heroku ps:scale web=1
    ```

## Post-Deployment

After deployment, you can verify that your application is running with the following command:

```bash
heroku open
```

This will open your application in a web browser. You can monitor your application with the following command:

```bash
heroku logs --tail
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during deployment, check the Heroku logs for error messages:

```bash
heroku logs
```

Common issues include missing environment variables and dependencies. Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured and all dependencies are listed in your `package.json` file.

If you encounter issues with the build process, ensure you have the correct versions of Node.js, npm, and TypeScript installed.
