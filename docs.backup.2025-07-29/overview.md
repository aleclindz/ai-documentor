# Project Overview: ai-documentor

## 1. Project Purpose

The `ai-documentor` is a software application designed to automatically generate comprehensive and accurate documentation for software projects. It is primarily intended for software developers and teams who require a quick and efficient way to document their codebase.

## 2. Technology Stack

The `ai-documentor` is built using a combination of frameworks, libraries, and tools. 

- **Express**: A fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js, used to build the backend server.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, although no files are currently present in the frontend.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler used for transforming modern ECMAScript code into a backwards compatible version.
- **Chalk**: A library for styling terminal strings.
- **Chokidar**: A library for watching file system changes.
- **Commander**: A complete solution for node.js command-line interfaces.
- **Dotenv**: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- **Glob**: A library for matching files using the patterns the shell uses.
- **Inquirer**: A collection of common interactive command line user interfaces.
- **Marked**: A markdown parser and compiler built for speed.
- **Mermaid**: A simple markdown-like script language for generating charts from text via JavaScript.
- **OpenAI**: A library for accessing the OpenAI API.
- **Ora**: A library for creating elegant terminal spinners.
- **Ts-morph**: A library for navigating TypeScript ASTs.
- **TypeScript**: A statically typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- **WS**: A simple to use, blazing fast, and thoroughly tested WebSocket client and server for Node.js.
