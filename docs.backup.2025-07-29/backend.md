# Backend API Documentation

This documentation provides comprehensive details about the backend API, including API endpoints, service functions, middleware, error handling, and database integration.

## API Endpoints

### 1. GET /

This is the root endpoint of the application. It does not require any parameters and does not return any specific response.

### 2. GET /api/overview

This endpoint provides an overview of the API. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing general information about the API.

### 3. GET /api/frontend

This endpoint provides information about the frontend of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing frontend-related information.

### 4. GET /api/backend

This endpoint provides information about the backend of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing backend-related information.

### 5. GET /api/database

This endpoint provides information about the database of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing database-related information.

### 6. GET /api/userflows

This endpoint provides information about the user flows of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing user flow-related information.

### 7. GET /api/architecture

This endpoint provides information about the architecture of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing architecture-related information.

### 8. GET /api/deployment

This endpoint provides information about the deployment of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing deployment-related information.

### 9. GET /api/troubleshooting

This endpoint provides troubleshooting information for the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing troubleshooting-related information.

### 10. POST /api/regenerate

This endpoint triggers a regeneration of the API documentation. It does not require any parameters and returns a success message upon completion.

### 11. GET /health

This endpoint checks the health status of the application. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON object containing the health status of the application.

### 12. GET /api/users

This endpoint retrieves all users from the database. It does not require any parameters and returns a JSON array of user objects.

### 13. POST /api/users

This endpoint creates a new user in the database. It requires a JSON object containing the user details and returns the created user object.

### 14. GET /users

This endpoint retrieves a specific user from the database. It requires the user ID as a parameter and returns the corresponding user object.

### 15. PUT /users/:id

This endpoint updates a specific user in the database. It requires the user ID as a parameter and a JSON object containing the updated user details. It returns the updated user object.

### 16. DELETE /users/:id

This endpoint deletes a specific user from the database. It requires the user ID as a parameter and returns a success message upon completion.

## Service Functions

The service functions are responsible for the business logic and data processing of the application. They interact with the database to retrieve, create, update, and delete data. Each function is designed to perform a specific task, such as fetching all users, creating a new user, updating a user, or deleting a user.

## Middleware

The middleware functions are used to perform operations that need to occur before the final request handler. They include authentication, validation, and logging.

- **Authentication**: The `authenticateToken` middleware function is used to verify the authenticity of the request. It checks if the request contains a valid token and allows the request to proceed if the token is valid.

- **Validation**: The `validationResult` middleware function is used to validate the data sent in the request. It checks if the data meets the specified validation rules and sends an error response if the data is invalid.

- **Logging**: The application uses middleware functions for logging requests and responses. They log the details of each request and response, including the request method, URL, status code, and response time.

## Error Handling

The application uses error handling middleware to manage and return errors. If an error occurs during the execution of a request, the error is passed to the error handling middleware, which sends an error response with the appropriate status code and error message.

## Database Integration

The application uses a database to store and manage data. The service functions interact with the database to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). They use database queries to retrieve, create, update, and delete data. The database integration is managed by the `userService` module, which provides functions for interacting with the user data in the database.
