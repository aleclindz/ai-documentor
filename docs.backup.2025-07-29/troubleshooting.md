## Common Setup Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- `Cannot find module` error during the initial setup.
- `Failed to compile` error when starting the application.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Missing or incorrect installation of dependencies.
- Incorrect environment variables in the `.env` file.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies.
2. Check the `.env` file for any missing or incorrect variables.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always run `npm install` after cloning the repository.
- Use a `.env.example` file to ensure all required environment variables are provided.

## Build Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- `Module not found` error during build.
- `Unexpected token` error during build.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Missing or incorrect import statements.
- Syntax errors in the code.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Check import statements for any missing or incorrect paths.
2. Use a linter like ESLint to catch syntax errors.

### Prevention Strategies
- Use a linter and formatter to catch and fix syntax errors during development.
- Always check the import paths when adding new files or moving existing ones.

## Runtime Errors

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Application crashes with `UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning`.
- Application throws `TypeError` or `ReferenceError`.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Unhandled promise rejections or async/await without try/catch.
- Undefined variables or properties.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Add `catch` blocks for all promises or use try/catch with async/await.
2. Check the code for any undefined variables or properties.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always handle promise rejections.
- Use TypeScript for static type checking.

## Performance Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- Slow application loading.
- High memory usage.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Inefficient algorithms or loops.
- Memory leaks due to unclosed resources or forgotten timeouts/intervals.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Optimize the code by using efficient algorithms and data structures.
2. Use tools like Chrome DevTools to find and fix memory leaks.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always close resources and clear timeouts/intervals.
- Regularly profile and optimize the code.

## Database Connectivity

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- `ECONNREFUSED` error when connecting to the database.
- `ER_BAD_FIELD_ERROR` when running queries.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect database connection parameters.
- Incorrect SQL queries.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Check the database connection parameters in the `.env` file.
2. Check the SQL queries for any syntax errors or non-existing fields.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always validate database connection parameters.
- Use an ORM or query builder to prevent SQL syntax errors.

## API Integration

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- `ECONNREFUSED` error when making API requests.
- `401 Unauthorized` error when making API requests.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect API endpoints or methods.
- Missing or incorrect API keys or tokens.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Check the API endpoints and methods in the code.
2. Check the API keys or tokens in the `.env` file.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always validate API endpoints, methods, and keys/tokens.
- Handle API errors and retry requests with exponential backoff.

## Deployment Issues

### Symptoms and Error Messages
- `Application crashed` error in the logs.
- `503 Service Unavailable` error when accessing the application.

### Root Cause Analysis
- Incorrect deployment configuration.
- Insufficient resources in the deployment environment.

### Step-by-Step Solutions
1. Check the deployment configuration for any errors.
2. Scale up the resources in the deployment environment if needed.

### Prevention Strategies
- Always validate deployment configuration.
- Monitor the application and scale resources as needed.
